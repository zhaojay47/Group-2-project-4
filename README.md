# Group-2-project-4
Group members consist of Jessica Zhao, Dayana Iciano, and Colven Benjamin.

Our group has chosen the topic of credit loan eligibility for this project. The main task is to develop an algorithm that 
analyzes credit scores and predicts whether a consumer is eligible for a personal loan. This prediction can be valuable for
financial institutions to make data-driven decisions and streamline their lending process. 

The tools used were:- 
Tableau: We used Tableau for data exploration and visualization. It helped us gain insights into the dataset and identify 
patterns and trends related to credit scores and loan eligibility. 
DashApp: We utilized DashApp, a Python web application framework, to develop interactive and user-friendly dashboards to present 
our machine learning models' predictions. 

The language used:- 
Python: Python was the primary langauge used for data analysis, model development, and web application implementation. 

The packages used:- 
pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis. 
numpy: Used for numerical computations and array operations.
seaborn: Used for data visualization and statistical plotting.
matplotlib: Used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
csv: Used for reading and writing CSV files. 

Future Enhancements:- 
As part of future enhancements, we plan to explore additional machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines and 
gradient boosting, to further improve the prediction accuracy. We also aim to incorporate more features and external data sources
to make the model more robust and comprehensive. 

Conclusion:
Our credit loan eligibility prediction project aims to assist financial institutions in making better lending decisions and help 
consumers understand their loan eligibility. By leveraging machine learning techniques and interactive visualization, we believe
our project can have a positive impact on the lending industry.
